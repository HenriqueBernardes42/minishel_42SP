This project is about creating a clone of Bash with the knowledge acquired from previous projects Minitalk and mostly Pipex.


### How to start:

```
make m
```


### Features:
- Run an executable in the system's $PATH or from an absolute or relative path 

- Bash built-ins: echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env and exit;

- Multi- Pipes && Redirections;

- Shell level: launch a new minishell from another. Don't forget to increment $SHLVL;

- Working history

- Bonus parts: wildcards, logical operators and parentheses.
