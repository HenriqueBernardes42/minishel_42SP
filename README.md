# Minishell, almost as awesome as Bash.

This project involves creating a clone of Bash with the knowledge acquired from previous projects Minitalk and mostly Pipex.

Features:
- Running an executable in the system's $PATH or by providing an absolute or relative path 
- Bash built-ins: echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env and exit;

- Multi- Pipes && Redirections;

- Shell level: launch a new minishell inside another and increment $SHLVL;
> One minishell is not enough, you have to go deeper!

- Command Working history (see readline library; only a few functions from readline's history library are allowed, so have fun with them and figure out a way to achieve your required behaviour)

- Bonus parts: wildcards, logical operators and parentheses.
